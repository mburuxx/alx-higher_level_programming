>>> s1 = "Best School"
>>> s2 = "Best School"
>>> print(s1 == s2)

The reason why print(l1 is l2) returns False is because l1 and l2 are two different list objects, even though they have the same contents. 
The is operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory, while == checks if they have the same value.
When you create a list like l1 = [1, 2, 3], Python creates a new list object in memory and assigns it to the variable l1. 
Similarly, when you create a list like l2 = [1, 2, 3], Python creates another new list object in memory and assigns it to the variable l2.
Therefore, l1 is l2 returns False because l1 and l2 point to different list objects in memory, even though they have the same contents.


>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
>>> print(l1 == l2)

In this case, print(s1 is s2) might return True or False, depending on the implementation of the Python interpreter and the specific strings being compared.
When you create a string like s1 = "Best School", Python creates a new string object in memory and assigns it to the variable s1. 
Similarly, when you create a string like s2 = "Best School", Python creates another new string object in memory and assigns it to the variable s2.
However, for optimization purposes, Python may choose to reuse string objects if they have the same contents. This is known as string interning. 
In some implementations of Python, string interning is performed automatically for small strings, and for string literals that appear multiple times in a program.
Therefore, depending on the implementation and the specific strings being compared, s1 is s2 may return True if the same string object is being reused, or it may 
return False if two separate string objects are being created.
In general, when comparing string objects for equality, it's recommended to use the == operator instead of is. 
The == operator checks if two strings have the same value, while is checks if they are the same object in memory.
